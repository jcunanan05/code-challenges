Challenge #1

Write a function called countRows() which will tell us the number of rows in our GRID. Remember that other lighthouse operators are going to be using this function, so it has to be able to work on a GRID of any size. It would be easy to write a function that just did return 12; but that wouldn't help operators with bigger or smaller areas!

You do NOT need to pass the GRID variable to the countRows() function, as it will be able to access it.
